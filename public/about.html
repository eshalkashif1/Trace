    <h2>About Trace</h2>
    <p>
      Trace is a community-driven platform that empowers individuals to report and
      visualize harassment hotspots, making our cities safer for everyone.
      Our mission is to make cities safer through shared awareness, data transparency, and collective empowerment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reports are mapped anonymously using privacy-preserving location blurring to ensure no individual is identifiable. 
      Trace highlights potential harassment hotspots, allowing communities, city planners, and organizations to take proactive steps toward safer environments.
      Beyond reporting, Trace includes a safer-route prototype that suggests lower-risk paths based on recent reports and contextual data. This empowers users to make informed decisions about their routes in real time. 
      Trace was built with a vision of empowering voices, one report at a time. 
    </p>
    <p>
    This ensures that every experience, however small, contributes to a larger picture of community safety and social change.
